= HQL Debugger

HQL Debugger is a development tool used to debug HQL queries.
It contains a copy of Hibernate's HQL grammar and parser source files, allowing you to use IDE ANTLR tools to test out queries and validate them.

* This software is not for general release given the original parser is LGPL.
* This software is copied but not run through any form of automation process, so it COULD be out-of-date based on updates to Hibernate.

See [HISTORY].
